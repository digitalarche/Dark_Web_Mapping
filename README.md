# Mapping Tor's Illicit Services & Exposing them
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As time goes on & as I hope to retire from Infosec for personal reasons I Haven't been releasing content or been enthused on how to do such a task well here's a repo of Keywords & Websites to monitor. We'll
Eventually produce a python3 script to just automate the task rather than forcing you to waste time by manually trying to apphend .onion sites with the directory you wish to sniff.


In this you'll find the following
- Keywords
- Directories
- Websites to build lists from
- Browser Extentions to automate tasks
- Scripts to remove/add stuff from Search Engine Results 
- Websites to map the internet out.
